\section{Combining Solvers}\label{Ch:BiphysicsSolvers:Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The entire purpose of building AMUSE was to be able to combine
numerical solvers into in order to realize more complext simulations.
One such combined simulations is simulating star clusters in with
solving for the motion of the stars is combined with the internal
evolutution of the stars. Many monolythic codes are available which
can now do this, in partiuclar for, what we could call the classical
approach of combination direct N-body simulations with parametrized
fits to pre-calculated stellar evolution. The earliest example of this
combinations goes back to the late 1980' \cite{1987MNRAS.224..193T}.
