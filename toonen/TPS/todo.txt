Topic: orbital change: the outer orbit affecting the inner
**********************
The effect on the inner orbit of mass transfer in the outer orbit is not included yet.
Regarding the effect on the inner orbit of wind mass loss of the outer star, it is assumed that no wind mass is accreted by the inner binary.

Topic: Roche lobe in an eccentric orbit
**********************
Done

The equations for the Roche lobe should be valid for eccentric orbits. 
Sepinsky et al. 2007 gives a prescription that should be solved numerically. Their fit to this is only valid between 0.1<q<10, 0<e<0.9 and 0<stellar_rotational_angular_velocities/orbital_angular_velocities_at_periastron<15. Adrian is implementing the two presciptions.

Update: There is another prescription from Sepinsky that is valid in a large range. It's implemented.

Topic: Parameters needed for e.g. tides
**********************
Done, except for:
    - apsiodal motion constant (we could possibly calculate this ourselves using MESA)
--


 A number of parameters of the stars are needed to calculate the tides, that are not available yet. These are:
    - gyration radius
    - envelope mass
    - envelope radius
    - apsiodal motion constant (we could possibly calculate this ourselves using MESA)

Other necessary parameters are:
    - wind mass loss rate

Unstable mass transfer in the outer binary, simulation stops. What should we do here?
Stable mass transfer in the outer binary, affects the inner binary as a sling shot (how exactly?)

Topic: Kill switch secular code
**********************
To do on long-term. 

If secular evolution is not significant, it should switch off to accelerate the calculations. Is it possible to switch of the secular evolution, but not orbital evolution due to mass transfer of wind mass loss? 
This also would be important for simulating the evolution of triples after a merger (when it's a binary).

Topic: Timesteps + order of running codes
**********************


Is this still necessary
Implement the posibility to go back in time:
- When after a certain timestep a star fills its Roche lobe due to stellar or secular evolution, we want to go back in time, to find accurately the time of Roche lobe filling, and model the mass transfer from that moment onwards. This probably puts a constraint on the order of running codes: first stellar evolution or first secular evolution?
-->
When we take into account the effect of wind mass loss to the orbit, there is a numerical error between the theoretical orbital change and the change calculated by us. The error is smaller when we first run the stellar evolution code, calculate the wind mass loss rate, and then run the secular evolution code. In the reversed order, the secular evolution takes the wind mass loss rate of the previous timestep, so that the actually mass lost in a certain timestep might not correspond to the wind mass loss rate times the timestep. The difference due to the order is about a factor 10 on the error on the final orbit. In order to reduce the error, smaller timesteps need to be taken. That also means that reversing the se and sec code, makes the code faster. 
This is a disadvantage, because it makes it more likely that we have to step back in time when roche lobe overflow occurs during a timestep. 

Done
Implement an adjustable timestep which is dependent on:
- stellar evolution (we do not want to miss a certain phase e.g. maximum radius at helium flash)
- binary evolution (if stable mass transfer occurs, the timestep should go down)

Topic: Tests
**********************
- mass transfer in the inner binary. Do the inner and outer binary behave as desired?
- wind mass loss in a very wide system. Do the inner and outer binary behave as desired?
- Are the timesteps given to Adrian's code sufficiently small to validate the assumptions of constant mass in his ccode?
- Tests do determine where we want the trade-off between speed and accuracy in the Adrian's code (for solving the differential equations)

- is there enough mass removed in the ce? does the star change type?

How do we organize the data output? Which information do we want to save?

Options:

- For now, different flags for when the code stops.

Topic: change_mass
**********************
- op dit moment dt<0 zodat mass transfer is conservatief, maar ik weet niet of dit goed gaat in adjust_accretor_radius
- change mass heeft zo zijn voor- en nadelen. 
    - add_mass neemt accretion_limit in rekening -> mooi voor mass transfer, niet voor wind
    - subtract mass neemt adjust_accretor_radius in rekening -> mooi voor thermische tijdschaal massaoverdracht, maar niet voor nucleair, aml of ce (na common envelope heb ik liever reduce mass dan subtract mass from donor, omdat daar geen adjust_accretor_radius in zit) -> maar na een ce, wordt de hele envelope gestript, en verandert de ster van stertype, en dan wordt geen adjust-accretor_radius toegepast
